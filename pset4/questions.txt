0.  BMP - 4 billion + (32 bit color); GIF - 256 (8 bit color); JPEG and PNG  - 
16 million + (24 bit color)
1.  GIF
2.  Lossless compression reduces file size but preserves a perfect image.
Lossy compression reduces file size at the expense of some amount of image
perfection. Lossy compression usually leads to smaller files than lossless.
3.  JPEG
4.  The first character of the file is changed to signal the file has been
deleted and the directory can be reused. The operating system moves the file's
FAT clusters to the hard drive's list of free clusters. The file itself is
not deleted.
5.  Use a file sanitizer
6.  bmp.h is a header file that provides typedefs for exact-width integer types
7.  This gets around the problem of C loosely defining its data types by 
aliasing integer types of an exact length
8.  BYTE = 1 byte; DWORD & LONG = 4 bytes; WORD = 2 bytes
9.  The first two bytes of any bmp file must be 0x4d42
10. bfSize is the size of the bitmap file header. biSize is the size of the
bitmap info header
10. biSize is the size of the structure (bitmapinfoheader plus color table) in
bytes. bfSize is the size of the bmp file
11. If biHeight is negative, the bmp is a top-down DIB, and its origin is in
the upper left hand corner
12. biBitCount specifies color depth
13. fopen might return NULL if the file doesn't exist or you don't have
the right permissions
14. The third argument to fread is always 1 becuase the data elements we are
reading in are 1 byte long
15. Since RGBTRIPLE is defined as being 3 bytes long, 
(4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4 = (4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4
= (4 - 9 % 4) % 4 = (4 - 1) % 4 = 3 % 4 = 3
16. fseek allows us to offset the position in the file by a certain amount of
bytes, from a certain point in the file (beginning, current, or end)
17. SEEK_CUR refers to our current position in the file
18. Hard to tell exactly whodunit. The face is male, probably either David
Malan or Jason Hirschhorn.
